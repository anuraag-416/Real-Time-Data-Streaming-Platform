Real-Time Data Streaming Platform
This project is a real-time data streaming platform built with Java Spring Boot and Apache Kafka. It allows for scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient real-time data processing and streaming.

Features
Producer Service: Publishes messages to Kafka topics.
Consumer Service: Listens to Kafka topics and processes incoming messages.
Streaming Pipeline: Processes and transforms data in real-time.
Resilient and Scalable: Built to handle large-scale streaming data workloads.
Monitoring: Integrated metrics for monitoring the health of the streaming pipeline.
Prerequisites
Java: Version 17 or higher
Maven: Version 3.6 or higher
Docker: For running Kafka and Zookeeper containers
Kafka: Version 3.x (via Docker)
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-streaming-platform.git
cd real-time-streaming-platform
2. Start Kafka Using Docker
A sample docker-compose.yml file is provided in the docker directory.

bash
Copy code
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
This will spin up the following services:

Zookeeper: Kafka's coordination service
Kafka Broker
3. Configure Application Properties
Modify application.yml in the src/main/resources directory as needed:

yaml
Copy code
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
    consumer:
      group-id: real-time-group
      auto-offset-reset: earliest
    producer:
      key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
      value-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
4. Build and Run the Application
Build the application using Maven:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/real-time-streaming-platform-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Project Structure
bash
Copy code
src/main/java
└── com.example.streaming
    ├── config          # Kafka and application configurations
    ├── producer        # Kafka producer services
    ├── consumer        # Kafka consumer services
    ├── controller      # REST endpoints for producer testing
    ├── model           # Data models used in the platform
    └── service         # Business logic and data processing
Usage
Sending Messages to Kafka
Use the REST endpoint to produce messages:

POST /api/produce

Payload Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "topic": "example-topic",
  "message": "Hello, Kafka!"
}
Consuming Messages
Consumers automatically listen to the configured topics and log the data to the console. Extend the consumer logic to add your custom processing.

Monitoring
Use tools like Kafka Manager, Conduktor, or Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring Kafka clusters.
Spring Boot's Actuator provides health checks and metrics at /actuator/health.
Testing
Run unit tests:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
Integration tests for Kafka can be written using libraries like spring-kafka-test.
